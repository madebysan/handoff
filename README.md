## What it does

Handoff walks you through twelve sections modeled on what estate attorneys cover with clients:

1. **The Basics** — who you are and why you're creating this
2. **Key Contacts** — family, attorneys, financial advisors
3. **Financial Accounts** — banks, investments, retirement
4. **Insurance Policies** — life, health, property, auto
5. **Property & Assets** — real estate, vehicles, valuables
6. **Digital Life** — device access, emails, passwords, subscriptions, social media
7. **Legal Documents** — will, power of attorney, advance directive
8. **Debts & Liabilities** — mortgages, loans, credit cards
9. **Business Interests** — ownership, partnerships
10. **Dependents & Pets** — care instructions and contacts
11. **Personal Wishes** — funeral, memorial, personal messages
12. **Sign & Finish** — signature, date, personal proof

When you're done, review your document and download a formatted PDF or Markdown file. Nothing is ever sent to a server — your data stays in your browser and leaves only when you download the document.
