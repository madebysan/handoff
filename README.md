<h1 align="center">Handoff</h1>
<p align="center">A guided interview that helps you organize everything your family would need to know — accounts, documents, wishes, and more — into a single letter of instruction you control entirely.</p>
<p align="center">React · Tailwind CSS · 100% client-side · No accounts · No servers</p>

## What it does

Handoff walks you through twelve sections modeled on what estate attorneys cover with clients:

1. **About You** — basic info and context
2. **Key Contacts** — family, attorneys, financial advisors
3. **Financial Accounts** — banks, investments, retirement
4. **Insurance Policies** — life, health, property, auto
5. **Property & Assets** — real estate, vehicles, valuables
6. **Digital Life** — emails, passwords, subscriptions, social media
7. **Legal Documents** — will, power of attorney, advance directive
8. **Debts & Liabilities** — mortgages, loans, credit cards
9. **Business Interests** — ownership, partnerships
10. **Dependents & Pets** — care instructions and contacts
11. **Personal Wishes** — funeral, memorial, personal messages
12. **Sign & Verify** — signature, date, family passphrase

When you're done, download a formatted PDF or Markdown file. Nothing is ever sent to a server — your data stays in your browser and leaves only when you download the document.
